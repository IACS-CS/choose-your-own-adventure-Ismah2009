    <h1>You're very loyal!</h1>
    <p>You want to stay with your new friend for now
      to learn more about him.</p>
    <p> You guys chat it up for the whole class. You learn
      so many new things about him and just vibe with the 
      guy. He ends up telling you
      how his dad is a co-owner of the boston celtics and how he
      has free season passes. He goes to all the games but has an
      extra seat he was saving for a new friend. Although you didn't
      sit with the girls, they are known for being tricksters with
      guys. You avoided trouble and now have celtics season passes! <b><i>THE END!</i></b></p>
