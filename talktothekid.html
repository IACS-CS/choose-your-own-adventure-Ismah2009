    <h1>+1 friend accquired</h1>
    <p>The kid seems chill so you want to get
      to know him more.<p>
    <p> You talk to the kid as you're walking to class and he's actually a chill dude.
      You find out that he has the same personality as
      you; alongside similar goals. He also tells you
      how his father owns one of the biggest gasoline
      branches in the world. As you guys are sitting in class
      two very pretty girls come up to you and ask for you to sit with them but,
      only you not your new friend. Do you go <a href="sitwiththegirls.html">sit with the girls</a> 
      or <a href="stickwithbuddy.html">stick with your buddy</a>?<p>
