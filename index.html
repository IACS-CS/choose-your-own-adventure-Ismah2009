    <h1>My first day in HIGH SCHOOL! <i>[Preferred for teenage boys.]</i></h1>
    <p>This is the beginning.</p>
    <p>It's your first day of highschool and as you're walking in the 
      halls, you see a kid that looks around your age by 
      himself. But also, as your walking towards him a
      big group of guys that look older than me come up
      and ask if you want to join their newfound group.
      <i>Should you continue to go and 
      <b><a href="talktothekid.html">talk to the kid </a></b>
      or  <b><a href="jointhegroup.html">join the group </a></b>
      to start off the year?</i>
    </p>
