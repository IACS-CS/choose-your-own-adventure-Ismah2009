    <h1>Time for hooping?</h1>
    <p>You want to show off your basketball skills to your
      newfound group!</p>
  
   <p>You and your group run 3s for about 10 minutes and you
   showed up to show out! Im talking this.</p>

  <ol> <!-- ordered list -->

  <li>Crossover!</li>
  <li>Stepback!</li>
  <li>Green bean!</li>
  <li>SWISH!</li>
  
  </ol>

   <p>But little did you know, the varsity
   head coach was watching you play. He comes up to you and
   offers you a spot in the varsity pre-season training camp. You get
   detention though because you were late to class by
   30 minutes and can't even play with the varsity. It was a waste!
   <b><i>THE END!</i></b></p>
