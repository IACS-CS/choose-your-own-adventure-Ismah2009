    <h1>You made it to class on time! Nerd?</h1>
  <p>You want to have a good reputation on the first day!
  </p>
  <p> You make it to class just in time for first
   period. You go on to be consistent in school and
   get straight A's. But, when the group walks in they tell you 
   how Jayson Tatum did a suprise drop-by at the school 
   and gave the group celtics game tickets. You missed out 
   on missing greatness but for your academics, maybe it was worth it!
   <b><i>THE END!</i></b></p>
